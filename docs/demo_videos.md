# Demo videos - start working with refgenie

Check out these demonstration videos, which show how to quickly start working with refgenie.

After refgenie Python package is installed with `pip install refgenie`, refgenie can be used with or without genome configuration file.

## Without config - remote mode

If used *without* genome configuration file, the data does not persist from session to session. It's really useful in cloud applications.

*Hint: all of these commands end with "r"*:

- `refgenie listr`
- `refgenie seekr`
- `refgenie populater`

## With config - local mode

If used *with* genome configuration file, the data persists from session to session. That's the most common scenario, you can `build`, `pull` and `seek` assets managed locally.
