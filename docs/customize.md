## Index list

Refgenie currently builds indexes for tools like bowtie2, hisat2, bismark (for DNA methylation), etc. You can find the complete list in the [config file](src/refgenie.yaml). These are all optional; you only have to build indexes for ones you intend to use. You can also add more later.




#### Optional

* Set an environment shell variable called `GENOMES` to point to where you want your references saved.
* Choose which indexes you want to include by toggling them in the [config file](src/refgenie.yaml).
